1. Import Project into your favorite IDE via SBT.
2. Users need a Twitter account for the Backchannel APP
3. Maybe you need to add the libraries from lib manually to your Project
4. Start the Server which is located in src.main.server.Server
5. Start the Client which is located in src.main.client.view.LoginView
